# Ionic Rocket

The best solution to bootstrap your HTML5 Mobile Application, created by [@yrezgui](https://github.com/yrezgui).

Ionic Rocket is a collection of tools for building easily your HTML5 mobile application from prototyping to production. It's a bunch of opensource libraries and frameworks. It is recommanded to use it on Unix systems (Linux, Mac OS, etc.) but it works on every platform supported by [@NodeJS](https://github.com/joyent/node).
